        <p class="mt-3 text-base text-neutral_Light sm:mt-5 sm:text-xl lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">For certain resources like research paper or books, there will be direct links thanks to projects like InternetArchive, LibGen, Arxiv, SciHub etc.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-base text-neutral_Light sm:mt-5 sm:text-xl lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">This requires us to build a giant taxonomy of all human knowledge. Arranging topics in a hierarchy is not sufficient. Instead we are creating a graph of topics and levels with multiple types of edges: "is-a-subtopic-of", "is-a-prerequisite-of" etc. If you are an expert or educator in some domain, you can contribute to this project via our GitHub repository.</p>

        <p class="mt-3 text-base text-neutral_Light sm:mt-5 sm:text-xl lg:text-lg xl:text-xl">In conjunction with this, we're also building an online game where this is presented as a skill-tree for life and allows you to chase ambitious life goals and keep track of your progress while inspiring and being inspired by your friends. More on this will be revealed soon.</p>
